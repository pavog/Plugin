## Statistics Introduction ##

Looking for a high-end plugin that tracks your players' data? Look no further!

There are a few similar plugins out there, and they track a decent amount of data, however,  
Statistics takes it a step further and completely overhauls the stats tracking, bringing the  
amount of information collected to a staggering amount. Name a data point, and we are  
probably tracking it. This plugin was made to be highly customizable; it will do only what  
you tell it to do.

## Statistics v2.0 ##

This is a new version of Statistics (v2.0) which is developed by Paul <pavog> Vogel.

The Bukkit Plugin of Statistics has been updated and is currently working. I am developing the v2 at the moment which will bring new features.
 - In the [Master branch](https://github.com/pavog/Statistics-Bukkit-Plugin "Statistics master branch") you find the currently working (and tested) code.
 - In the [Development branch](https://github.com/pavog/Statistics-Bukkit-Plugin/tree/dev "Statistics dev branch") you find the code for v2 which is under heavy development and my not work.
