## Statistics ##

Looking for a high-end plugin that tracks your players' data? Look no further!

There are a few similar plugins out there, and they track a decent amount of data, however,  
Statistics takes it a step further and completely overhauls the stats tracking, bringing the  
amount of information collected to a staggering amount. Name a data point, and we are  
probably tracking it. This plugin was made to be highly customizable; it will do only what  
you tell it to do.
